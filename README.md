# CS56 Legacy Code project Fall 2017 with Siyao Li and William Stansbury

This project takes the derivative of Polynomials inputted by the user.

Running the program prompts the user to input a polynomial string. The user must include spaces between numbers and operators. For example: "x + 1" is valid, while "x+1" is not. This restriction of how the string can  be read is due to Professor Conrad's Polynomial class we are working from.

If a valid polynomial string is inputted by the user, That string is converted to Polynomial type, passed through the derivative function, and the derivative of the given function is printed out for the user.
