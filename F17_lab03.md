(a)The program will take a polynomial and return its derivative.

(b)The current software does nothing.

(c)Software does not run.

(d) User stories
  * User inputs a string into the terminal, and the derivative of the input polynomial prints out.
  * Maybe print out a graph of the polynomial after user inputs the polynomial as a string.

(e)There is almost nothing in the README. This file should include more details about the program. For example, this program will take a polynomial and return its derivative.

(f)There is no build.xml file. The targets should be added probably are "run", "compile", "test", "javadoc".

(g)The current issues are achievable. They are clear in what the expectations are. However, they migh tnot be ambitious enough to earn 1000 points.

(h)
  * We could graph the inputted polynomial as well as the derivative that we are returning.
  * We could also include a user interface for inputting and displaying data.

(i)There is currenlty no code, so there is nothing to assess.

(j)There are currently no tests, so there is nothing to assess.
